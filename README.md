# My Project
This is the backend for an interaction-based game where the player tries to uncover the secrets and motivations of AI-powered NPCs through conversation.

## Overview
The system manages various agents, such as NPCs, the Narrator, and Retrieval Agents, by connecting to an API that interacts with a model representing these agents. 
The agents will be able to respond dynamically to the playerâ€™s actions and attitude, adjusting their behavior accordingly through function calling. For example, an NPC might become less 
friendly if the player behaves negatively. Each NPC will have secrets and knowledge that the player will attempt to uncover through conversation.
